## Description

At liberal arts colleges, how do we as faculty assist our students in finding high-quality internships and job opportunities when we are a small (relatively unknown?) school?  Most of our students go on to a career in industry, and we find ourselves with a dire need to provide information on local job opportunities or bring potential employers to campus.  However, our small school doesn't have the name brand recognition of top-tier computer science schools schools or even well-known state schools.  At Rollins, we often struggle with recruiting potential employers to come to campus because we have fewer majors and we have a name brand school (UCF) just across town.  This session would focus on a discussion of how other LACs approach this problem, strategies which have been successful, and how to prepare our students to sell their own liberal arts education and compete with students from better known schools.
